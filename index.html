Semantic Web for Social Good
ISWC 2018 Workshop


Many Social Good topics can benefit from the sort of unplanned, cross-domain, rapid-prototyping analysis that Linked Data makes possible. 
Weâ€™ve learned that measuring topics like poverty, health, economic opportunity and equality can be substantially more nuanced by considering broader categories of data than organizations traditionally collect for their own use. 
There have been individual past presentations on topics that involve Semantic Web for Social Good. 
This workshop is intended to present multiple topics, to better identify intersections, overlaps, opportunities for accelerated advancement, and opportunities for shared abstractions.
